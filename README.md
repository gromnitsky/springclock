# springclock

A handy countdown for small phones & huge TV screens. Originally
(2017) this was an excuse to play with vh/vw CSS units, then is was
rewritten to support multiple countdown events in a queue that could
be useful in a classroom or during a series of meetings.

After the app is loaded, click on the clock at the bottom of the
screen.
